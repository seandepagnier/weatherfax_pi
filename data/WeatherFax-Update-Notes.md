Basically everything in this file have been reviewed and corrected or discarded.:

    Mauricius: Discarded
    Singapore: Discarded but awaiting for a reply from them hopefully
    Japan: Discarded
    South Africa: Updated
    French Polynesia: Updated
    Chile: Remapped (one Mercator changed to Fixed-Flat and one Conic to Polar)
    PWx, GFS, ECMWF and UKMO for a better coverage
    Europe: Updated

weatherfax_pi/data/MET-strdate-work-needed.md is obsolete too.

=====================
1. Mauritius – Files exist confirmed via browser on the web, accessible vie the homepage within browser.  Directly URL access not possilbe….Protection of some sort?

2. Singapore – This needs work. Several charts, wave height and swell, no longer work. Format must has changed. The surface wind charts work.

3. Japan - Unable to calibrate the charts, format is not polar or anything similar. Also VERY small, numbers hard to read,  left at the best compromise

4. South Africa - Internals of the website must have changed, not able to get any access to the charts.

5. French Polynesia – same thing as in SA.

6. Chile – Polar file is hard to calibrate almost impossible to get a perfect mapping.

7. We need better coverage for Asia, Malysia and Japan.

8. We have lost some sources for Europe and could use more coverage.
