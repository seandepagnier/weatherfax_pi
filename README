Weather Fax Plugin for OpenCPN
=======================================
Implement weather fax ability for opencpn.  This includes retrieval via sound card (radio fax) as well as the internet, or local image files.

Compiling
=========


* git clone git://github.com/seandepagnier/weatherfax_pi.git


Build as normally:

* cd ..
* cd build
* cmake .. # To produce a binary compatible with Windows XP, you must set the respective toolset - use 'cmake -T v120_xp ..'
* make
* make install

Windows Specific Libraries
==========================
The Windows compilation is dependent on these files 

Under windows, you must find the file "opencpn.lib" (Visual Studio) or "libopencpn.dll.a" (mingw) which is built in the build directory after compiling opencpn.  This file must be copied to the plugin directory.

There are also some libraries and an external program needed:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencpnplugins/files/opencpn_packaging_data/portaudio-vc12.7z/download
http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencpnplugins/files/opencpn_packaging_data/PVW32Con.exe/download (not an archive, this one just copy to buildwin)
and unpack all these files into the buildwin directory as the compile is dependent on these.

Note to Windows Users:
To have a completely "clean" install (if you have not created any Weatherfax URLs or new CoordinateSets.
1. Uninstall the previous version of Weatherfax_pi using "Uninstall weatherfax_pi.exe" found in the C:\Program Files (x86)\OpenCPN (version) directory.
2. Delete the following files  from C:\ProgramData\opencpn\plugins\weatherfax
 CoordinateSets.xml
 UserCoordinateSets.xml
Or you will have remnants of the previous installation and any work you have done to coordinates, which may or may not be applicable.
3. This new version of the weatherfax XML files is very different from previous versions. Many MET urls have changed and the old ones no longer work.


OSX Specific Libraries
==========================
The OS X compilation is dependent on these files 

Under OS X the port audio library is needed. Install it using ```brew install portaudio```
There is a zip file containing header and library files:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencpnplugins/files/weatherfax_pi/OSXportaudiofiles.zip/download
Download this file and unzip it in the /usr/local directory as the compile is dependent on these.
The make create-pkg command will include the library in the package.
